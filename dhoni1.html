            <h1>Personal Information</h1>
            <p>His ancestral village is Lwali, which is in Jaiti taluka of Almora district of the Uttarakhand state. The village has population of 20 to 30 families. His father Pan Singh Dhoni left the village in 1970 for employment. He eventually settled in Ranchi. Dhoni's uncle Dhanpat Singh Dhauni and his cousin Hayat Singh Dhauni still live in Lwali.<br>
                
                He married Sakshi Singh Rawat on 4 July 2010.<br>
                
                The wedding took place in Dehradun, one day after the couple got engaged. Dhoni and his wife have one daughter, Zeeva Dhoni.<br>
                
                Dhoni is an enthusiast of the Indian Army. While spending a day with the parachute regiment in Ranchi, Dhoni said, "Since childhood I wanted to join the Army. Seeing the soldiers, I thought one day I'll be the same". <br>
                
                He holds the post of vice-president marketing in India Cements Ltd. The company is headed by former BCCI president and IPL franchise Chennai Super Kings owner N. Srinivasan.</p>
                <h3>Early Life and Background</h3>
                <p>Dhoni was born in Ranchi, Bihar (now in Jharkhand) and hails from a Hindu Rajput family to parents from Uttarakhand. He is the youngest of three children of Pan Singh and Devaki Devi. His paternal village Lwali, is in Jainti Tehsil, Lamgara block of the Almora District of Uttarakhand. His parents moved from Uttarakhand to Ranchi, Jharkhand where his father worked as a pump operator in junior management position in MECON Colony situated in Doranda area in Ranchi. Unlike Dhoni, his uncle and cousins spell their surname "Dhauni".
                    
                Previously Dhoni was the goalkeeper for his DAV Jawahar Vidya Mandir school's football team, but after seeing his goalkeeping skills, coach Keshav Ranjan Banerjee, one who inspired Dhoni to be a cricketer, picked him to play cricket for his school team. His exceptional wicketkeeping skills allowed him to become the regular wicketkeeper at the Commando Cricket Club (1995 - 1998). Based on his performance at club cricket, he was picked for the 1997/98 season Vinoo Mankad Trophy Under-16 Championship, where he performed well
                
                From 2001 to 2003, Dhoni worked as a Travelling Ticket Examiner (TTE) at Kharagpur railway station under South Eastern Railway in Midnapore (W), a district in West Bengal.</p>

            <h1>Earlier Cricket life</h1>
            <h3>Junior cricket in Bihar</h3>
            <p>In 1998, Dhoni was selected by Deval Sahay, a former Bihar Cricket Association Vice President and Ranchi District Cricket
                 President, to play for the Central Coal Fields Limited (CCL) team. Till 1998 Dhoni, who was in 12th grade,
                 had never played professional cricket. At CCL, he got an opportunity to bat higher up the order, where he
                 performed exceptionally, which had helped CCL move to the A division. Deval Sahay, impressed by his performance, 
                 pushed for his selection in the Bihar team. Dhoni moved to the Ranchi team, the junior Bihar cricket team and 
                 eventually the senior Bihar Ranji Team within one year.
                 
                 In the 1998-99 Cooch Behar Trophy, Dhoni played for the U-19 Bihar team and scored 176 runs in 5 matches (7 innings).
                 However, Bihar finished fourth in the group of six and did not make it to the quarter-finals. Dhoni was not picked for 
                 the East Zone U-19 squad (CK Nayudu Trophy) or Rest of India squad (MA Chidambaram Trophy and Vinoo Mankad Trophy). 
                 In the 1999 -2000 Cooch Behar Trophy, the Bihar U-19 cricket team made it to the finals, where Dhoni's 84 helped Bihar post a total of 357.
                 Nevertheless, Bihar's efforts were thwarted by Punjab's 839 with Dhoni's future teammate Yuvraj Singh making 358.Dhoni's 
                 contribution in the tournament included 488 runs (9 matches, 12 innings), 5 fifties, 17 catches and 7 stumpings. Dhoni made it to the East
                 Zone U-19 squad for the CK Nayudu trophy in the 1999 - 2000 season but scored only 97 runs in four matches, as East Zone lost all four matches
                 and finished last in the tournament.
                </p>
                <h3>Bihar Cricket team</h3>
                <p>Dhoni made his Ranji Trophy debut for Bihar in the 1999-2000 season, as an eighteen-year-old. He made a half century in his debut match scoring 68* in
                    the second innings against Assam cricket team. Dhoni finished the season with 283 runs in 5 matches. Dhoni scored his maiden first-class century
                    while playing for Bihar against Bengal in the 2000/01 season. Apart from this century, his performance in the 2000/01 season did not include 
                    
                    another score over fifty and in the 2001/02 season, he scored just five fifties in four Ranji matches.
                </p>
                <h3>Jharkhand Cricket Team</h3>
                <p>Dhoni's performance in the 2002-03 season included three half-centuries in the Ranji Trophy and a couple of half-centuries in the Deodhar Trophy, 
                    as he started gaining recognition for his lower-order contribution as well as hard-hitting batting style. In the 2003/04 season, Dhoni scored a 
                    century (128*) against Assam in the first match of the Ranji ODI tournament. Dhoni was part of the East Zone squad that won the Deodhar Trophy 
                    2003â€“2004 season and contributed with 244 runs in 4 matches, including a century (114) against Central zone.
                    
                    In the Duleep Trophy finals, Dhoni was picked over international cricketer Deep Dasgupta to represent East Zone.He scored a fighting half-century
                    in the second innings in a losing cause. Dhoni's talent was discovered via the BCCI's small-town talent-spotting initiative TRDW. Dhoni was discovered by TRDO
                    Prakash Poddar, captain of Bengal in the 1960s, when he saw Dhoni play for Jharkhand at a match in Jamshedpur in 2003, and sent a report to the National Cricket Academy.
                </p>
                <h3>India A team</h3>
                <p>
                    He was recognised for his efforts in the 2003/04 season, especially in the One Day format and was picked for the India A squad for a tour of Zimbabwe and Kenya.
                    Against the Zimbabwe XI in Harare Sports Club, Dhoni had his best wicket-keeping effort with 7 catches and 4 stumpings in the match. In the tri-nation tournament
                    involving Kenya, India A and Pakistan A, Dhoni helped India A chase down their target of 223 against Pakistan A with a half-century. Continuing his good performance,
                    he scored back to back centuries - 120 and 119* against the same team. Dhoni scored 362 runs in 6 innings at an average of 72.40 and his performance in the series 
                    received attention from the then Indian captain - Sourav Ganguly and Ravi Shastri, amongst others.
